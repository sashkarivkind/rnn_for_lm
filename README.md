# rnn_for_lm
RNN for Language modeling. Based on Tensorflow. Some functions to explore the RNN from the dynamic systems point of view are available.
### Further documentation
Will be added soon.
### Reference
The starting point for this code was a [flat RNN by Andrej Karpathy](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086.js).
It aslo uses some building blocks from an unpublished code by Maayan Shviro and Itay Zalic.
